Activities Planning App 
Description: Create an app that allows users to plan their activities for the day, week or month and generate a list of activities based on their daily, weekly and monthly needs. The app could suggest activities based on time and day while allowing users to select their favorite activities.

Problem: Human is to error and people forget a lot, People frequently forget about little tasks and little activities that they should be completing throughout the day the week and the month. An application which reminds its users of a particular activity that should be done at particular time and date will definitely solve this particular problem.

My activities is an app that will allow its users to set reminders to desired activities to be completed at desired time on the day to day calendar.

Marketing strategy: we will use blogs and common social media platforms such as Twitter Facebook YouTube Instagram and TikTok to advertise our app and I think people will like it and find it very useful.
